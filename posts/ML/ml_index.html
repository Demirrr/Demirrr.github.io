<p>The goal of this article is to show the beauty of SVM and deliver enough information and intuition to reader who is interested in usage of SVM. Breaking SVM into small pieces could be quite demanding but I assure the reader that it will worth it.</p> 

<p>I highly recommend the reader to firstly watch lectures which are given by 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/sKQoJ/using-an-svm">Andrew Ng</a>
and 
<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/lecture-16-learning-support-vector-machines/
">Patrick Winston</a>. 
While Andrew Ng provides very good intution, Patrick Winston shows the beauty of underlying matematics on SVM.</p>
